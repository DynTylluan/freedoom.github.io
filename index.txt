The Freedoom project aims to create a complete
https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html[free content] game based
on the _Doom_ engine.

Combined with the engine, _Freedoom_ is also compatible with game
modifications (``mods'') made for the original _Doom_ games, made by
_Doom_ fans and artists over the decades.

For more information, see the link:about.html[What is Freedoom?] page.

------------

2015-12-15: Freedoom 0.10 released
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another large update to Freedoom, representing many changes to the
game, giving a better feel for being an independent game and fleshing
out neglected areas of the project.  We're not done yet, but close!

  * Brand new status bar.
  * New sprites for the serpent and orb monster.
  * New HUD graphics for the single- and double-barrel shotguns,
    missile launcher, and SKAG.
  * New pain sounds for many monsters and the player.
  * New maps in _Phase 1_ and _Phase 2_.

2014-10-14: Freedoom 0.9 released
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This version represents rather large, sweeping changes to Freedoom,
easily one of the best releases we've had in years and we are
extremely proud to be able to release it for all to enjoy!

  * New file names no longer conflict with _Doom_'s
  * FreeDM and Phase 1 have grown out of the shadows of the project
    and have seen rapid advances.
  * New text font to replace the old one in all menus, in-game text,
    and status-bar HUD.
  * New zombie, shotgun zombie, and assault tripod sprites by a
    skilled pixel artist.
  * New sounds for the dark soldier.
  * More complete support for _Final Doom_ mods, adding many more
    textures missing to support mods for both _TNT: Evilution_ and
    _The Plutonia Experiment_.

\... and there are many, many more changes, too long to mention here,
but it's more fun to play than to read, isn't it?

2014-01-01: Freedoom 0.8 released
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Those responsible for the lack of releases since too long ago have
been sacked. Not really, but enjoy a shiny new release, and we'll
promise to stop with the -rc and -beta stuff from here on!
