Help Freedoom!
==============

Freedoom is always looking for help. This is a short list of some of
the resources that the project is in need of. If you can help out,
please check the forum or IRC links in the sidebar to get in contact!

Artists
-------

**Flame bringer sprites**: Freedoom needs sprites for the "flame
bringer" monster. This is a monster encountered in Freedoom Phase 2
which has the ability to raise other monsters from the dead and set
the player on fire. If you're an artist or 3D modeller you can help
out here.

**Pain Lord**: Freedoom has sprites for its Pain Lord monster, but
they are based on some incomplete concept sketches, and in need of
colorizing and cleaning up. Ideally, additional animation frames are
needed to fully develop the monster.

**FreeDM logo**: FreeDM, Freedoom's deathmatch spinoff project, is
looking for a logo. This will appear on the title screen and in the
game on billboards. See
http://www.doomworld.com/vb/freedoom/66962-freedm-needs-a-logo/[this discussion thread]
for more information.

**Menu font and status bar**: The font used for Freedoom's menu and
intermission screen graphics is not very good and in need of
replacing. The status bar (shows the current health, armor, etc.) also
needs improving, and having a consistent look between the two would be
good.

Musicians
---------

**In-level music**: Freedoom needs music for its levels. Presently
some of the music tracks are serving double duty for multiple levels.
FreeDM, the deathmatch spinoff project, also needs some appropriate
music for its levels.

**OPL synth instruments**: If you like chiptunes, particularly for the
Yamaha OPL2/OPL3 synth chips, then Freedoom needs instruments for its
OPL MIDI instrument bank. Check out the
https://github.com/freedoom/freedoom/tree/master/lumps/genmidi[documentation]
to find out more.

Level authors
-------------

**New levels**: Freedoom is still in need of new single player levels
in order to get a complete set of levels for both of its single player
campaigns.  If you see a level that is just a square room with an exit
switch, that is a currently unfilled slot. If you are experienced
making Doom levels and can spend the time to make a level for
Freedoom, or maybe you have levels you've made and can donate to the
project, please get in touch.

**Bugs**: Sometimes bugs get reported in Freedoom's levels. Check out the
https://github.com/freedoom/freedoom/issues?labels=levels&page=1&state=open[bug list]
to see what currently needs fixing.
