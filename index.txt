Introduction
------------

The Freedoom project aims to create a complete
http://opensource.org/[open source] game based on the _Doom_ engine.

Combined with the engine, Freedoom is also compatible with game
modifications (`mods') made for the original _Doom_ games, made by
_Doom_ fans and artists over the last 20 years.

Download
--------

_Freedoom_ is available in three versions, representing different
level packs and compatibility with multiple versions of the classic
_Doom_ franchise from id Software.

https://github.com/freedoom/freedoom/releases/download/v0.8/freedoom-iwad-v0.8.zip[Freedoom]::

    The primary _Freedoom_ version, featuring 32 levels in one massive
    chapter. It is compatible with _Doom II_ mods.

https://github.com/freedoom/freedoom/releases/download/v0.8/freedoom-ultimate-v0.8.zip[Ultimate Freedoom]::

    An alternative game, with 36 different levels split into four
    chapters. It is compatible with mods for the original _Doom_
    and _The Ultimate Doom_.

https://github.com/freedoom/freedoom/releases/download/v0.8/freedm-v0.8.zip[FreeDM]::

    Beat your friends in these 32 levels designed for competitive
    deathmatch play.

_Freedoom_ requires the additional download of a game engine to
play. The following three ports are highly recommended by the
_Freedoom_ project:

http://odamex.net/[Odamex]::

    Odamex is a premier engine focusing on an old school game-play
    look and feel and specializing in multiplayer capabilities.

http://dengine.net/[Doomsday Engine]::

    Doomsday is an advanced engine with an emphasis on graphical
    enhancements.

http://prboom.sourceforge.net/[PrBoom]::

    PrBoom maintains a prestiguous status with speedrunners due to
    high compatibility with many historical engines.

These engines, and http://doomwiki.org/wiki/Source_port[many others],
are made possible thanks to the _Doom_ engine being released as
http://opensource.org/[open source] in 1997.
