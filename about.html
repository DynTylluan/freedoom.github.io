<p><a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/">id Software</a> has released the
source code to their classic game, <em><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(video_game)">Doom</a></em>, under
the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public
License</a>.  This means that the engine which powers <em>Doom</em> is <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software</a>.
However, the game engine is only one component of a complete game.</p>

<p>The <em>Doom</em> engine uses an
"<a href="http://doomwiki.org/wiki/IWAD">IWAD</a>" file to store all
of its game data.  This contains the raw data used by the game — the
artwork, sound effects, levels, everything which defines Doom as a
game.  Until now, one of the original proprietary files was still
needed in order to play <em>Doom</em>.</p>

<p>The Freedoom project aims at collaboratively creating a free IWAD
file.  Combined with the free source code, this results in a complete
game based on the <em>Doom</em> engine which is Free Software.</p>

<h3>The purpose of Freedoom</h3>

<p>Freedoom has multiple purposes:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>To create a complete free game based on the
		<em>Doom</em> engine.</strong><br />
		A large <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/">library</a>
		exists of modifications which have been created for <em>Doom</em>
		over the past fifteen years; Freedoom maintains compatibility
		with the original IWAD files so that these modifications can be
		played.</li>
	<li><strong>To create a pool of free game material for people to
		reuse in their own projects.</strong><br />
		All material in the Freedoom project is released under the
		<a href="https://github.com/chungy/freedoom/blob/master/COPYING">
		modified BSD license</a>, allowing people to reuse it as they
		wish.  Freedoom contains a large collection of material.  This
		includes <em>Doom</em> levels, sound effects, graphics, and
		music.</li>
	<li><strong>To serve as a demonstration of the talent and creativity
		of the <em>Doom</em> community.</strong><br />
		Despite its age, <em>Doom</em> has retained a surprisingly large
		community of fans.  Freedoom is developed collaboratively by
		fans of the original <em>Doom</em> games.</li>
