<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The Freedoom project aims to create a complete Doom-based game which
is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free
Software</a>.</p>

<p>Combined with a free source port, people will also be able to play
the back catalog of extensions made to Doom by hobbyists over the last
15 years.</p>

<p>For more information, see the <a href="about.html">What is
Freedoom?</a> page.</p>

<h3>Freedoom is looking for help</h3>
<p>We need people to help by submitting resources for the project.</p>

<h3>2014-01-01: Freedoom 0.8 released!</h3>
<p>Those responsible for the lack of releases since too long ago have
been sacked. Not really, but enjoy a shiny new release, and we'll
promise to stop with the -rc and -beta stuff from here on!</p>

<h3>2012-05-12: Freedoom 0.8-beta1 released!</h3>
<p>Been a long way since 0.7, hope it's worth it!  There are a lot of
changes to be had in this version, all over the place.  Please
download and help work out the bugs to make this the best release yet!</p>

<h3>2011-01-22: Freedoom 0.7 released.</h3>
<p>It's been a few years since 0.6, and we are now at the next major version
number for Freedoom, 0.7.  There are plenty of new materials to be found,
please check it out!</p>

<h3>2010-09-15: Freedoom 0.7-rc1 released.</h3>
<p>Over a year, and we're finally entering the release candidate stage
for 0.7!  Lots of new changes are in this release, it's a <em>major</em>
update.  Please check it out and help us polish this release!</p>

<h3>2009-06-15: Freedoom 0.6.4 released.</h3>
<p>A copyright violation has been found in the Freedoom tree and has
been removed.  This is the only change from 0.6.3, but it removes much
of the music.  All previous versions are pulled from the download area
at the moment since they were all tainted.</p>

<h3>2009-01-01: Freedoom 0.6.3 released!</h3>
<p>After nearly nine months, Freedoom gives birth to yet another
release!  This is primarily bug fix release with a few additional
features.  Let's hope for a bright 0.7 release!</p>
