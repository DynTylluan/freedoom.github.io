_Freedoom_ is available in three versions, representing different
level packs and compatibility with multiple versions of the classic
_Doom_ franchise from id Software.

    The primary _Freedoom_ version, featuring 32 levels in one massive
    chapter. It is compatible with _Doom II_ mods.

    chapters. It is compatible with mods for the original _Doom_

    Beat your friends in these 32 levels designed for competitive
    deathmatch play.

_Freedoom_ requires the additional download of a game engine to
play. The following three ports are highly recommended by the
_Freedoom_ project:

http://odamex.net/[Odamex]::

    Odamex focuses on old school game-play and its advanced
    multiplayer capabilities.

http://dengine.net/[Doomsday Engine]::

    Doomsday is an advanced engine with an emphasis on graphical
    enhancements.

http://prboom-plus.sourceforge.net/[PrBoom+]::

    PrBoom+ is often prefered by speedrunners due to its high
    compatibility with historical engines.

These engines, and http://doomwiki.org/wiki/Source_port[many others],
are made possible thanks to the _Doom_ engine being released as
https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html[free software] in 1997.
