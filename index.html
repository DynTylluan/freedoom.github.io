<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The Freedoom project aims to create a complete Doom-based game which
is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free
Software</a>.</p>

<p>Combined with a free source port, people will also be able to play
the back catalog of extensions made to Doom by hobbyists over the last
15 years.</p>

<p>For more information, see the <a href="about.html">What is
Freedoom?</a> page.</p>

<h3>Permament news: Freedoom is looking for help</h3>
<p>We need people to help by submitting resources for the project.</p>
<p>If you think you could help, please visit the <a

<h3>2010-09-15: Freedoom 0.7-rc1 released.</h3>
<p>Over a year, and we're finally entering the release candidate stage
for 0.7!  Lots of new changes are in this release, it's a <em>major</em>
update.  Please check it out and help us polish this release!</p>

<h3>2009-06-15: Freedoom 0.6.4 released.</h3>
<p>A copyright violation has been found in the Freedoom tree and has
been removed.  This is the only change from 0.6.3, but it removes much
of the music.  All previous versions are pulled from the download area
at the moment since they were all tainted.</p>

<h3>2009-01-01: Freedoom 0.6.3 released!</h3>
<p>After nearly nine months, Freedoom gives birth to yet another
release!  This is primarily bug fix release with a few additional
features.  Let's hope for a bright 0.7 release!</p>

<h3>2008-12-23: Freedoom has moved to a new site!</h3>
<p>Following new project maintenence, Freedoom is now hosted on <a
href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/">Savannah</a>, for both ethical
(emphasis on Free Software) and technical reasons (git support!).  For
the most part, users and contributors won't notice much difference, the
primary advantages are on the part of the maintainers.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/">Savannah</a> for
hosting and <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/">Doomworld</a> for
