The Freedoom project aims to create a complete
https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html[free content] game based
on the _Doom_ engine.

Combined with the engine, Freedoom is also compatible with game
modifications (`mods') made for the original _Doom_ games, made by
_Doom_ fans and artists over the decades.
