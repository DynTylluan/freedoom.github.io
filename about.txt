The Freedoom project aims to create a complete first person shooter
game that is http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html[free software].
http://www.idsoftware.com/[id Software] released the source code to
their classic game,
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(video_game)[_Doom_], under the
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html[GNU General
Public License]. This means that the program code that powers
_Doom_ is free; Freedoom complements this with free levels, artwork,
sound effects and music to make a completely free game.

Freedoom is actually three games in one, consisting of two single
player campaigns and one set of levels intended for multiplayer
deathmatch.

There is a massive 20 year
http://doomwiki.org/wiki/Idgames_archive[back catalog]
containing thousands of Doom mods made by fans of the original
game. Freedoom is compatible with these mods and allows them to be
played without the need to use any non-free software.

Just like how https://www.gnu.org/[the GNU project] was started to
develop a free operating system to replace Unix, we aim to provide a
free replacement for Doom. If you have artistic skills
(visual, musical, or maybe you just like making levels!) then you can
help us achieve that aim by contributing to the project!

Freedoom contains hundreds of original textures, sound effects
and music tracks that can be reused royalty-free by Doom level authors
and other independent game developers.

Freedoom is liberally licensed under the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses[BSD license] - all that is
required is that you include a copyright statement that credits the
Freedoom project.
