The Freedoom project aims to create a complete
https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html[free content] game based
on the _Doom_ engine.

Combined with the engine, Freedoom is also compatible with game
modifications (`mods') made for the original _Doom_ games, made by
_Doom_ fans and artists over the decades.

For more information, see the link:about.html[What is Freedoom?] page.

for 0.7! Lots of new changes are in this release, it's a major

2009-06-15: Freedoom 0.6.4 released
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A copyright violation has been found in the Freedoom tree and has been
removed. This is the only change from 0.6.3, but it removes much of
the music. All previous versions are pulled from the download area at
the moment since they were all tainted.
