Game data
---------

_Freedoom_ is available in two versions, the first of which is a
single-player focused game, split in two parts, each of which is
compatible with different versions of the classic _Doom_ franchise
from id Software.  The second is a multiplayer-focused experience for
the popular ``deathmatch'' game mode.

    _Phase 1_ is the first part of the single-player game, containing
    four chapters which are nine levels each, smoothly paced for
    beginner players.  It is compatible with mods for the original
    _Doom_ and _The Ultimate Doom_.

    _Phase 2_ is the second major part of the single-player game, a
    massive 32-level chapter expanding upon the same concepts present
    in _Phase 1_, as well as containing additional monsters and the
    double-barreled shotgun!  The levels in this game tend to demand
    more skillful play than the previous chapters.  It is compatible
    with mods for _Doom II_ and _Final Doom_.

https://github.com/freedoom/freedoom/releases/download/v0.11.2/freedm-0.11.2.zip[FreeDM]::

    _FreeDM_ is a fast-paced competitive deathmatch game, part of the
    Freedoom project.  Rather than the usual single-player focused
    levels, these contain no monsters and are intended for deathmatch
    only.  It is compatible with mods for _Doom II_ and _Final Doom_.

Engine
------

_Freedoom_ requires the additional download of a game engine to
play. The following engines are highly recommended by the _Freedoom_
project:

[horizontal]
http://odamex.net/[Odamex]::

    Odamex focuses on old school game-play and advanced
    multiplayer capabilities.

https://fabiangreffrath.github.io/crispy-doom[Crispy Doom]::

    Crispy Doom is a minimalist engine, adding few extra features to
    the engine and offering an easy setup for single-player games.

http://prboom-plus.sourceforge.net/[PrBoom+]::

    PrBoom+ is often prefered by speedrunners due to its high
    compatibility with historical engines.

These engines, and https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Source_port[many others],
are made possible thanks to the _Doom_ engine being released as
https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html[free software] in 1997.
