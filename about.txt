What is Freedoom?
-----------------

http://www.idsoftware.com/[id Software] released the source code to
their classic game,
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(video_game)[_Doom_], under the
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html[GNU General
Public License]. This means that the engine which powers _Doom_ is
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html[free software]. However,
the game engine is only one component of a complete game.

The _Doom_ engine uses an http://doomwiki.org/wiki/IWAD[*IWAD*] file
to store all of the game data. This contains the raw data used by the
game -- the artwork, sound effects, levels, and everything which
defines _Doom_ as a game. Until now, one of the original non-free
files was still needed in order to play _Doom_.

The _Freedoom_ project aims at collaboratively creating a free IWAD
file. Combined with the source code, this results in a complete game
based on the _Doom_ engine.

The purpose of Freedoom
-----------------------

Freedoom has multiple purposes:

    1. *To create a complete free game based on the _Doom_ engine.* +
        A large http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/[library] exists of
        modifications which have been created for _Doom_ over the past
        twenty years; Freedoom maintains compatibility with the
        original IWAD files so that this modifications can be played.

    2. *To create a pool of free game material for people to reuse in
    their own projects*. +
        All material in the _Freedoom_ project is released under a
        https://github.com/freedoom/freedoom/blob/master/COPYING[modified
        BSD license], allowing people to reuse it as they
        wish. _Freedoom_ contains a large collection of material. This
        includes levels, sound effects, graphics, and music.

    3. *To serve as a demonstration of the talent and creativity of
    the _Doom_ community.* +
        Despite its age, _Doom_ has retained a surprisingly large
        community of fans. _Freedoom_ is developed collaboratively by
        fans of the original _Doom_ games.
