The Freedoom project aims to create a complete
https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html[free content] game based
on the _Doom_ engine.

Combined with the engine, _Freedoom_ is also compatible with game
modifications (``mods'') made for the original _Doom_ games, made by
_Doom_ fans and artists over the decades.

2017-02-16: Freedoom 0.11 released
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another year, and one of _Freedoom_'s biggest updates has arrived!
One of the major developments we've had is the elimination of Boom as
the target engine for game support.  While we are aiming for an
eventual compatibility with Vanilla _Doom_, _Freedoom_ should
presently run on any limit-removing engine, which is nearly all of
them.

  * Lots of new music.
  * New levels, including C1M1 kicking off _Phase 1_.
  * Aquatex: over 200 new textures for mappers to use.
  * New intermission screens.
  * Some new weapon sprites: new pistol, new pickups.
  * New medkit and armor pickup sprites.
  * New project logo. ðŸ˜€

2015-12-23: Freedoom 0.10.1 released
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only a week, and we have a minor point release.  This repairs an
incompatibility discovered with _Phase 1_ in C3M7 while running in
Boom 2.02.  It also includes a fully-completed set of sprites for
the flame bringer in _Phase 2_ and _FreeDM_.

2015-12-15: Freedoom 0.10 released
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another large update to Freedoom, representing many changes to the
game, giving a better feel for being an independent game and fleshing
out neglected areas of the project.  We're not done yet, but close!

  * Brand new status bar.
  * New sprites for the serpent and orb monster.
  * New HUD graphics for the single- and double-barrel shotguns,
    missile launcher, and SKAG.
  * New pain sounds for many monsters and the player.
  * New maps in _Phase 1_ and _Phase 2_.
